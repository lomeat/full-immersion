*Please note that this mod is in its early stage.*
This mod gives Fallout 4 players the ability to craft ammunition. 
As of right now, almost every type of ammunition has been added.
If anyone has any recommendations for a different crafting recipe
that makes sense with the materials given in-game, let me know.
This mod was made to capitalize on something Bethesda left out of the game and that was needed in my eyes.
Thank you for downloading and keep your eye on this mod, updates may be coming soon!
